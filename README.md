# React Concepts Practice Project

This project is a beginner-level React.js application created to practice and understand the core concepts of React development. The primary focus of this project was **learning**—not UI/UX or responsiveness. It works best on **laptops/desktops only**.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with the following key React concepts:
- **Components** (Function-based)
- **Props**
- **State Management** using `useState`
- **API Integration** using `Axios`

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- React.js (Functional Components)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Axios for API calls
- Basic TailwindCSS for layout

## 🚫 Limitations

- ❌ **Not responsive**: This project is **not optimized for mobile or tablet screens**.
- 🎨 **Basic UI**: No focus was placed on design or user experience. The UI is minimal and built only to support functionality testing.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through building this project, I improved my understanding of:
- Breaking UI into reusable components
- Passing and using props
- Managing component state using `useState`
- Making GET requests and handling API responses using `Axios`
- Structuring a React project for learning purposes
